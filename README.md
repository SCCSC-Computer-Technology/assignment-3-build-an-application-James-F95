So i tried with a database and my access database would not work 
then I couldn't get my sql file to work and I am still learning
how to work sql so I had to just make a list.
This is why i did not add all the extra bells and whistles to make you be able 
to add to a database. Working on this thorough covid I am
just glad I got something here that works.
You can pull up a state and the next form comes up with all the information
