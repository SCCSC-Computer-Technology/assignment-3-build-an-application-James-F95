Code review for James Fowler:
Anna Stefanacci

Code Compilation and Warnings:

- I was able to run this code with no issues, and I also read your readMe. I have a note at the bottom for that! :)

Readability and Documentation:

- I would recommend adding comments to your code. While the variables and code were easy enough to understand, adding comments would greatly improve readability. 

Repetitive Code and Dead Code:

- There are no instances of dead code.
- I understand the redunancy of your code due to your struggle with adding a database.

Software Defects and Testing:

- I had no issues running, testing, or even attempting to break the code. (You even made sure I couldn't type into any of the textBoxes!)

Appropriateness of Framework and Code Usage:

- Although this program didn't exactly meet the requirements of the assignment. The use of methods and constructors was valid and thorough. 

Constructive Feedback:

- I completely understand the struggle of adding a database. I am also taking sql right now, so I used an access database to link my data. Here is how I did it:

At the top, if you go to project > add new datasource > click database > dataset > new connection > microsoft access database file > browse > click the file you want to link > and make sure you test connection. After that you should be linked.

Where you might run into issues under the database properties:

click project at the top > all the way at the bottom is should be YourProgram_Properties (for me it's States_AnnaStefanacci_CPT206_Properties) > click build on the left-hand side > if "prefer 32-bit" is clicked on turn it off

That was my issue, and I have to - for whatever reason - fix that everyime I link an access database. Hope that helps!!
