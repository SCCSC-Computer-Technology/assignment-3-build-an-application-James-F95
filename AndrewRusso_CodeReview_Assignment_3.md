It was smart to at least meet as much of the brief as you could. One way or another. I too struggled with SQL. Honestly I made an access database for this initially but overheard another student in my SQL class complaining that it didn't work and they were forced to convert it to SQL. So i skipped over messing with it as an Access database nad just converted it straight away. The adding object as a LINQ to SQL database was also something that threw me as we had only done it once before and after over a week of issues I had completely forgotten. I'm not sure if any of these things were struggles you had as well, but I just wanted to say good work accomplishing anything and not letting the covid and other set backs keep you from doing anything.

Adding the "else" in the messagebox was a good call. I attempted to type in something random and having the message pop up as a warning is a good idea. Going forward I will probably use this sort of if statement to make sure the info in the drop down is valid, or look into preventing manual entry.

I'm not going to touch upon aspects this program is missing that it was supposed to have, you know what they were and its beside the point. This is still a well designed and executed program, filling in the missing bits in the future is something I think you'll be more then capable of doing.
