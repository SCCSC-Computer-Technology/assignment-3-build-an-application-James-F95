James Folwer code review by Aaron Rash

Obviously its not what you wanted lol but major respect for delivering a product instead of giving up

Code is pretty solid, your class and constructor get the job done.

Just for fun, lets run with your workaround. 

You said you used access, but that wasnt working, so you eventually used a list.

From access, you can export a table as a text file/csv. (not sure if you did that)

You could then put that text file in your project, and read in the file using something like "StreamReader"

Add a loop, use delimiters, with some messing around you could automate adding all that info.

Might be a bit more complicated but it could cut your code down 200ish lines probably

Good job making it happen despite the circumstances
